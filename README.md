Questions I researched and answers I found:

Q- Should I be placing links <a> inside of <h2> elements? Or the other way around? What is the correct standard?
A- It's subjective [there is no standard]. You can only place <h2> elements within <a> elements if you're working with HTML5, which allows any other elements within <a> elements. Previous specifications ... never allowed this.

The usual way of doing this is to place <a> within <h2>. This works, has always worked, and has been the only valid way to do it before HTML5...

Q- Best methods for organizing files and folders?
A- Use an image file for images. As I acquire more files, I can create more folders, including a resource folder that will include css, js, images, data, and other folders as the project expands.
